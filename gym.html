          <p class="lead" id="bsy">At Canvasy, Elliptical trainers are primarily driven by the user's legs, and most are
            combination designs having handle-levers attached to each pedal-link to enable some burden on the arms and
            to
            provide a secondary source of driving power. The user grips the handles below shoulder height and pushes and
            pulls the arms while shuffling the feet back and forth within elliptically-shaped paths. Thus the
            oscillating
            handle-motions are dependent on – and coordinated with – the constrained pedal-motions. Some poorly designed
            machines are too dependent on the user's leg power, producing excessive handle speeds due to mechanical
            ratios
            that do not provide enough mechanical advantage to the handle-levers.
            a comfortable standing position with his or her spine in a neutral position (with a straight back). The user
            aligns their knees, hips and ankles; and ensures that their weight is distributed between the heels and the
            balls of the feet. The user grips the handrails in a smooth controlled motion, striding either in a forward
            or
            reverse motion, working through a full natural range of movement smoothly and continuously.</p>

            within
            an indoor setting – this is fantastic for those who prefer home based exercise or those who aren’t confident
            running outside.Primarily your lungs in regards to developing your general fitness but treadmills can also
            provide a great core and leg workout (you use these areas when you run) especially when used with an incline
            (uphill) settingOne of the best aspects of cardio (cardiovascular) machinery is that the world is your
            oyster!
            You can perform steady state (long distance) cardio at a moderate intensity or crank things up and perform
            some
            interval training (varying intensities on repeat) as well as performance based cardio at higher intensities.

            setting – this is one of the only cardiovascular machines that involves the arms almost as much as the
            legs.As
            it’s a cardio machine you’re going to work the lungs and improve your fitness – in conjunction with this
            expect
            to get a great leg and arm workout.You can perform steady state and interval cardio at a basic level, but
            you’ll
            find that some rowing machines actually include inbuilt games too so that you don’t get bored on your
            fitness
            journey. Performance based cardio (operating at near maximal levels) is also possible with a rower.</p>

            while targeting all aspects of the lower body – spinners are perhaps a little more versatile in terms of the
            exercises you can perform on them as their frame usually accommodates standing up in the saddle a little
            more
            comfortably than a standard upright bike.You can use a spin bike to perform all forms of cardio safe in the

            hamstrings,
            the glutes and the calves with different foot positions yielding a different area being prioritized at
            once.You
            can safely and effectively target any muscle in the lower body through either applying a foot stance that
            targets an even balance of all of them at once or slightly altering your stance to prioritize a certain
