            protein is a complete protein source and contains all 9 essential amino acids. Protein is particularly
            useful when ingested just after a workout because it helps to stimulate protein synthesis and facilitate
            recovery. Many people worry that whey protein will make them bulky or that it is like taking steroids, but
            whey protein is just a dried isolated milk powder</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading" id="trad">2. Creatine</h2>
          <p class="lead">Creatine is a naturally occurring amino acid found in meat and fish as well as being naturally
            produced by the body in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas. Creatine is converted to creatine phosphate, which
            we use for energy during high-intensity, short duration exercise, such as sprinting or heavy weight lifting.
            Creatine supplements can be bought in various forms, from flavoured powders to pills and are taken in order
            to enhance the body's ability to create energy and increase muscle mass. The increased energy from creatine
            enables users to lift more in the gym and, therefore, create more muscle mass. Creatine also gives the
            illusion of weight gain and larger muscles due to increased water retention, this is because water is drawn
            into the muscles along with creatine, causing the muscles to appear larger and creating a weight gain of
            anywhere up to 3lbs.

          </h2>
          <p class="lead">
            BCAA stands for branched chain amino acids. These are composed of 3 of our 9 essential amino acids,
            essential because our bodies do not produce them naturally and, therefore, they have to be sourced through
            diet. BCAAs are made up of Valine, Leucine and Isoleucine. The most popular usage for BCAA supplementation
            is to improve exercise performance and prevent going catabolic (muscle breakdown). This supplement is
            another way to increase your protein intake and therefore improve muscle repair and recovery.</p>

          <p class="lead" id="sta">Supplementing your training with caffeine is thought to increase energy, decrease
            fatigue and lower your perception of pain. When we are training, our bodies are constantly sourcing the
            energy to give the exercise our all. This energy comes in the form of glycogen, your body's stored form of
            carbohydrate. Caffeine slows down the speed at which we use up all our glycogen stores by promoting the use
            of fat as fuel. Fat is far more abundant than glycogen and what caffeine does is mobilise the body's fat
            stores to encourage working muscles to save glycogen and use fat as an alternative. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">5. Fish Oils </h2>
          <p class="lead">Fish oils are taken to boost your intake of Omega three fatty acids and are used as a
            treatment for a variety of health issues including heart disease, ADHD, anxiety, depression, high
            cholesterol, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes. When it comes to
            training, this supplement has been found to be particularly useful for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
            purposes. Research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce DOMS and speed up the recovery process.
            There is also evidence to show that when combined with BCAAs and carbohydrates, fish oils can increase the
            rate of protein synthesis, leading to greater gains in muscle mass. As fish oils are such a widely used
            supplement, there is a lot of choice on the market and some tablets come in cheaper for a reason. Be sure to
            check the labels to look for impurities and check the dosage, you should be looking for at least 1000 mg.
